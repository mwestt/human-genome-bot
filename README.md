The greatest story ever written. Tweeting out the entire GRCh38 Human Reference Genome, 280 bases at a time.

This repository hosts code for a Twitter bot ([@HumanGenomeBot](https://twitter.com/HumanGenomeBot)) that is scheduled to tweet the entire human genome from start to finish.

With each tweet limited to 280 characters, the 3.1b bases of the human genome are going to require approximately 11 million tweets to get through. 

With Twitter/X Free-tier access to the API limiting the bot to 50 tweets a day, this project is scheduled to finish in approximately 620 years.
